### Version Release Commit

Make sure to separate version release from other changes. See past release
commits for reference.

### Tagging

Tags in the format v1.2.3 are permanent tags and should never be moved. For
convenience, a feature tag should represent the latest patch version of a
feature version, with the format v1.2. For example, when releasing v1.5.0, also
create tag v1.5 on same commit. Then, when releasing v1.5.1, move tag v1.5 to
the same commit as v1.5.1.
